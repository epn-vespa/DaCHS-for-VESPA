SBNAF

Configuration file for the SBNAF service in Konkoly Observatory, can be used as template and adapted.


- the q.rd builds the service from a csv file. Data consist in measured IR flux of asteroids; they are located entirely in the EPNCore table, with no file attached. Ephemerides at time of observation are provided though datalink.
